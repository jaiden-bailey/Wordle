# Wordle Game


Welcome to Wordle! This is a simple Python console-based game where players can challenge themselves to guess a random 5-letter word. The game uses a set of words from the NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) dataset, and it randomly selects a word or name for the player to guess.
It also allows for words to be read and used from a text file. 


# Requirements
Python 3.x
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) library
termcolor library
Make sure you have Python and the required libraries installed before running the game.
